    You are walking on a normal day.
Suddenly, everything goes black. You feel as if
you are spinning and falling. Then you are in a
dark stone passageway. After you recover from
your dizziness, you look around. You see two doors
on one wall labeled:"Area 1" and "Area 2". One way
in the passage, it goes as far as you can see. The
other way there is a bend and a sign saying: "dead
end" Which way do you go?

    You open the door. There is darkness there. Nothing
more. Suddenly, you feel a force pulling you into the
darkness. You are unable to stop yourself from flying
out into the void. As you float into the darkness, you
see the door shutting.

    Then, you fall. As you are falling, you wonder if
that is the end of you. Then you hit a trampoline.You
see that you are in a grassy valley surrounded by fir
trees. You also notice tall bushes covered in flowers.
There are a few boxes around you.

    You can go into the forest, open some boxes, or
wait until dark.
